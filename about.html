          <h3>Hello !</h3>
          <p class="hello">I am <b>Oveek</b>, Avik Chakraborty from Kalyani a small town near Kolkata, India. Currently I am in Pune city of Maharashtra. By profession I am a Software Engineer currently
          working with <span>Accenture</span>.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Webaholic</h3>
          You hardly find me without
          my laapy and when my face isn't pressed against its screen you could expect me trapped inside a pile of books. I strongly believe in knowledge rather than in experience
          and always eager to prove the same.
          <br><br>
          I have a strong background in Java and Java/JEE based technologies like Spring (Spring MVC, Spring REST, Spring Data, Spring JDBC etc), Hibernate and currently working with
          UI and UX. I have worked with JS framework like EmberJS, AngularJS etc. Apart from these I am very much interested in
          Cloud based system architecture and Continuous Integration technologies.
          <br><br>
          I love to raed and write blogs and presently very much involved in designing this site, so I would love to get feedback from all of you.

          Hello! I am Avik Chakraborty. My native friends call me Oveek !! I'm Software professional from India currently working with Accenture. You hardly find me without
          my laapy and when my face isn't pressed against its screen you could expect me trapped inside a pile of books. I strongly believe in knowledge rather than in experience
          and always eager to prove the same.
          <br><br>
          I have a strong background in Java and Java/JEE based technologies like Spring (Spring MVC, Spring REST, Spring Data, Spring JDBC etc), Hibernate and currently working with
          UI and UX. I have worked with JS framework like EmberJS, AngularJS etc. Apart from these I am very much interested in
          Cloud based system architecture and Continuous Integration technologies.
          <br><br>
          I love to raed and write blogs and presently very much involved in designing this site, so I would love to get feedback from all of you.
